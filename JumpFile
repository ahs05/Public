**Subject:** Request for Additional Users for Windows 11 Upgrade Testing

Hi Marge,

Hope you're doing well.

Would it be possible to provide us with 3 additional users who can go through the Windows 11 upgrade early next week?

We’d like to cover a few more test cases before we can confidently move forward with having users access ACG ImageRight on Windows 11. So far, we’ve successfully upgraded both *Rebecca Brisby* and *Ryan Rubin* to Windows 11, and we did not encounter the issue we were expecting.

From the list you previously shared, we are considering the following users for the next round of testing:

* Lauregett

Additionally, we were able to complete the installation test successfully. However, we could not test the functionality or first-launch behavior of the app, as ACG ImageRight appears to require a user login or license to access.

Would it be possible for you to provide a test user account, or temporarily assign a license to one of our engineers so we can perform a full test? The license can be reclaimed once our testing is complete.

Please let us know your thoughts or if there are any concerns.

Best regards,
\[Your Name]
\[Your Position]
