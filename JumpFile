Subject: Request for AD Extension Attributes to Support User Persona Implementation

Hello Team,

I am reaching out to request your assistance with an **Active Directory configuration requirement** related to an ongoing ACG initiative.

**Requirement:**
We need to have **five (5) AD extension attributes created** and request **permission to update the values of these attributes for user objects** in Active Directory.

**Background:**
The **TCS Transformation team** is currently working on implementing **User Personas for ACG**. The objective of this initiative is to enable **persona-based application deployment**, ensuring that end users receive only the applications relevant to their role/persona.

To support this design, the user persona information needs to be stored and managed within **Active Directory**, which is why the extension attributes are required.

**Request / Ask:**
As part of the implementation, we were advised to coordinate with the **AD Security team** to:

* Create the required extension attributes, and
* Provide appropriate access for our team to manage the attribute values for user objects.

If there is an **established internal process, approval workflow, or security review** required to proceed with this request, please let us know. We will be happy to follow the necessary steps and provide any supporting documentation.

**Next Steps:**
I will be scheduling a meeting shortly to discuss the requirement in more detail, address any security considerations, and align on next steps.

Thank you in advance for your support and guidance.

Best regards,
Ari K

Subject: Technical Request: AD Extension Attributes & Delegated Access for User Personas

Hello Team,

I am reaching out to request your support on an **Active Directory configuration change** required for an ongoing ACG initiative led by the TCS Transformation team.

**Requirement Overview:**
We need to leverage **five (5) user-level attributes in Active Directory** to store and manage **User Persona identifiers**. Our preference is to utilize existing **extensionAttribute fields** (e.g., extensionAttribute1–15) if available, rather than introducing new custom schema attributes, to minimize schema impact and risk.

If the existing extensionAttributes are already allocated or reserved, we are open to discussing:

* Creation of **new custom schema attributes**, or
* Alternative supported attributes that align with AD governance standards.

**Use Case / Background:**
The User Persona framework will drive **persona-based application deployment**, ensuring applications are dynamically installed based on the user’s assigned persona. These attributes will act as authoritative signals consumed by downstream systems (e.g., SCCM / Intune) for targeting and automation.

**Access & Delegation Model:**
We are requesting **delegated permissions** (not full administrative rights) to:

* **Write/modify only the specified attributes**
* **Scope access to user objects only**
* Ideally restrict delegation to a **dedicated AD security group or service account**, following least-privilege principles

We do **not** require permissions to create or modify schema objects directly, unless explicitly required by the agreed design.

**Governance & Process:**
If there is an **internal change process, schema review board, or security approval workflow** that needs to be followed for:

* Attribute usage confirmation,
* Schema extensions (if needed), or
* Delegation approval,

please let us know the required steps and documentation. We will align fully with AD governance standards.

**Next Steps:**
I will be scheduling a working session to:

* Confirm attribute strategy (extensionAttribute vs. custom schema)
* Review delegation and security boundaries
* Align on implementation timelines and ownership

Thank you in advance for your guidance and support.

Best regards,
Ari K


Third One: 

Absolutely! I’ve **merged both versions** into a single, cohesive email that keeps the **clarity and flow of the first** while integrating the **technical depth, schema considerations, and delegation model from the second**. Here’s the polished version:

If you want, I can also **draft an even tighter “CAB-ready” version** that would read perfectly for AD Security approval workflow and change management systems.

Do you want me to do that?
