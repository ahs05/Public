**Subject:** Windows 11 Deployment Strategy – Parallel UAT & Production Rollout Across Rollout Groups

Hi \[Leader's Name],

As part of our Windows 11 Production Deployment approach, I wanted to share an update on the tactical strategy we’re implementing across Business Units and Departments.

To meet our aggressive timeline and ensure minimal disruption to operations, we are adopting a **parallel progression model** — where **Pilot/UAT testing will continue for certain Rollout Groups while Production deployment proceeds for others**.

This phased strategy has already been piloted successfully within our Legacy ACG branches and is now being scaled organization-wide. Key highlights include:

* Each Rollout Group will follow a dual-track structure:
  • **UAT/Pilot Testing** to validate compatibility and gather feedback
  • **Production Rollout** to progress deployment in alignment with the master schedule
* While this introduces some intentional overlap between testing and rollout, it allows us to stay on course for our **June 13th Production Launch** for the first RG.
* Mitigation measures include:
  • Sign-off checkpoints and device readiness validation
  • Targeted communications and feedback loops
  • Hypercare support model to address issues post-rollout

To help illustrate this approach, I’ve attached a **visual representation** of our deployment model below:

Please let me know if you’d like a walk-through or if there are any concerns you'd like addressed ahead of go-live.
