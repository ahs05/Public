**Subject:** Update on Deployment Schedule for Pilot Users

Hi Kenny,

Thank you for your message, and apologies for the confusion earlier.

Since you requested the listed users be part of the **Pilot Deployment**, we are proceeding to include them in our **Monday (06/09) weekday deployment**.

To clarify, our usual **UAT/Early Adopter testing deployments** involved us reaching out to users to volunteer for the Windows 11 Upgrade. These deployments typically began on Fridays with a completion target of the following Monday.

However, for pilot deployments—and going forward with other UAT deployments—we are aligning with our **production deployment methodology**, which runs on **weekdays only**.

We also agree with your recommendation to **“consider the pilot much like a production deployment,”** and will be following that approach consistently moving ahead.

Please let us know if you need any further details or adjustments.

Best regards,
**Engineering Desktop Management**
