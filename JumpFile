Here are **clean, professional rephrasings** of both statements:

1. **“The script executes daily on the (N+1)ᵗʰ day at 1:30 AM EST to consolidate the CSV file covering data from 00:00:00 to 23:59:59 of the previous day.”**

2. **“An FTP job runs daily on the (N+1)ᵗʰ day at 8:30 PM EST.”**

If you want them **more concise**, **more technical**, or **more business-friendly**, tell me the audience and I’ll adjust.
