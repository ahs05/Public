**Subject:** Approval Request – SCCM Site Upgrade (v2409 → v2609)

Hi Joe,

We are seeking a **green signal from ACG** to proceed with the **SCCM site upgrade** from **version 2409 to 2609**.

**Planned upgrade window**

* **Start:** Thursday, **January 17** at **7:00 PM ET**
* **End:** Monday, **January 20** at **7:00 AM ET**

As a heads-up, **Monday, January 20 is MLK Day**, which provides an ideal window to complete all **post-upgrade validation and cleanup activities** with minimal business impact.

The **detailed task list and timelines** covering **pre-upgrade, upgrade, and post-upgrade activities** are documented in the attached spreadsheet. The dates and times are currently aligned to the proposed window and will be **finalized and updated once the upgrade dates are confirmed**.

We have **successfully completed multiple SCCM site upgrades in the past** and do not anticipate any issues. Additionally, we will be performing the **same upgrade on the SCCM lab environment ahead of production** to validate changes and avoid any surprises in the production environment.

If there are any **environment-level initiatives or dependencies** that could conflict with this upgrade window, please let us know so we can adjust our schedule accordingly. We are planning to proceed **after the completion of all Windows 11–related activities** to avoid overlap.

Please let us know if ACG has any concerns or if additional information is required for approval.

Thanks,
**[Your Name]**
**[Your Title / Team]**
**[Contact Information]**

If you want, I can:

* Make it **more executive-level**
* Make it **more technical**
* Adjust tone for **CAB / Change Management**
* Add **risk & rollback language**

Just tell me the audience.
