Roadmap for 2026
Planned Initiatives & Strategic Goals
1. Advance Zero Trust & Modern Management

Expand Zero Trust capabilities and further ACG’s Modern Management journey through:

Implementation and optimization of Windows 365 and Entra Join

Strengthening Conditional Access and device compliance enforcement

Completed: Foundational policy alignment and readiness assessment

Pending:

Broader workload enablement on Entra-joined devices

Conditional Access tuning and exception reduction

Expansion of cloud-native provisioning scenarios

2. Expand Automation for Application Lifecycle Management

Continue automation maturity by leveraging WinGet-based updating and deployment to reduce manual packaging effort and improve application currency.

Focus areas include automation for commonly used third-party applications such as:

Notepad++

Zoom

7-Zip

Similar frequently updated productivity tools

This initiative aims to increase operational efficiency, standardize update mechanisms, and minimize manual intervention across the endpoint estate.

3. Complete Migration of BitLocker Recovery Keys to Entra ID

Migrate the remaining BitLocker recovery keys from the legacy on-premises Active Directory environment to Entra ID / Intune, enabling:

Independent recovery-key retrieval by DSS and Service Desk teams

Reduced dependency on IAM and infrastructure teams

Improved security posture and operational resilience

4. Platform Convergence for Mac Device Management

Consolidate endpoint management platforms by transitioning macOS device management from Jamf to Intune, delivering:

Tool consolidation and simplified operational model

Cost optimization through reduced platform overlap

Alignment with single-pane modern management strategy

5. Application Footprint Optimization & Cost Efficiency

Leverage SCCM application metering and usage insights to identify low-utilization or unused applications and enable:

Reduction of the overall application footprint

Lower licensing, support, and patching overhead

Improved endpoint performance and manageability

Tangible cost-saving opportunities across the environment

6. Streamline Imaging & Deployment Experience

Optimize Task Sequence images by removing redundant or unused components to:

Improve device performance

Reduce OS deployment time

Simplify image maintenance and supportability

7. Modernize Driver Management During OSD

Enhance OS deployment by enabling dynamic driver acquisition from vendor repositories during imaging, allowing:

Elimination of manual driver packaging

Deployment of current, model-specific drivers

Reduced maintenance overhead and improved deployment reliability

8. Enhance Operational Visibility Through Power BI

Implement integrated Power BI reporting connected to SCCM and Intune to provide:

Automated operational and compliance insights

Visually rich leadership-ready dashboards

Improved decision-making through real-time visibility

10. Strengthen Application Control & Endpoint Hardening (AppLocker)

Advance Zero Trust endpoint protection through phased AppLocker implementation via Intune, beginning with audit-mode telemetry collection and progressing toward a default-deny, allow-listed application model aligned with security best practices.

This initiative builds on existing engineering validation and logging readiness, complements SentinelOne’s detection and containment capabilities, and will transition to controlled enforcement following performance validation and enterprise allow-list definition—enhancing protection against unauthorized software while aligning with ACG’s modern security posture
