**Subject:** Interest in Meemic Opening – Local/Remote Work Opportunity from Independence, OH

Dear \[Manager's Name],

I hope you're doing well. My name is Harish Kakarla, and I currently support End User Computing initiatives at Auto Club Group (ACG) out of Dearborn, Michigan. I’ve been working remotely from Independence, Ohio—where ACG also has a physical office I can report to as needed.

I’ve been with ACG since 2021, initially as a contractor, and was recently hired into TCS after the EUC team transitioned. Over the past few years, I’ve led and supported major migration and endpoint management efforts across ACG, including collaborations with Meemic, ACICF, Carolinas, and Colorado teams.

I came across an opening within Meemic and wanted to respectfully express my interest. I apologize in advance if this is not the appropriate channel for reaching out. I have not yet applied through the official careers portal, but before doing so, I wanted to ask if there might be an opportunity to contribute to your team while continuing to work from Independence, OH—either remotely or from our local ACG office.

I bring over 8 years of experience as a **Sr. MECM-Intune Cloud Mobility Engineer**, with deep expertise in:

* **Enterprise device management** using Microsoft Intune and MECM (SCCM)
* **Autopilot, MDM/MAM policies, and cloud-based security baselines**
* **Automation and scripting** using PowerShell for deployments, reporting, and remediation
* **ServiceNow integration**, JAMF for macOS device management, and Microsoft Graph API

I’ve consistently delivered secure, scalable solutions while collaborating across cross-functional teams. My former manager Joe Zoch, along with several senior leaders, would be happy to speak to the value and results of my work.

If appropriate, I would be glad to send my full resume for your review. Please feel free to reach me via this personal email or my ACG work email: \[Your ACG Email Address].

Thank you very much for your time and consideration.

Warm regards,
