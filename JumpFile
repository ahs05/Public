- 🟢 BEGINNER — EXPANDED ANSWERS

 1. What is Jamf and what problems does it solve?

Jamf is an Apple-first device management platform that leverages Apple’s native MDM framework to securely enroll, configure, secure, and manage macOS, iOS, iPadOS, and tvOS devices. It solves problems such as zero-touch provisioning, enforcing security controls like FileVault, managing software distribution, and providing visibility into device inventory—all while respecting Apple’s security and privacy model.

 2. Main components of Jamf Pro?

Jamf Pro consists of:

* Jamf Pro Server (cloud or on-prem)
* Database (MySQL)
* Jamf Pro web UI
* Jamf binary installed on Macs
* Self Service app for users
  Each component plays a role in policy execution, inventory, and user interaction.

 3. How does Jamf differ from SCCM?

Jamf is MDM-driven and OS-enforced, while SCCM is agent-driven and OS-intrusive. Jamf cannot bypass Apple security boundaries (by design), whereas SCCM historically relied on deep system access. Jamf is purpose-built for Apple platforms, while SCCM primarily targets Windows.

 4. What is Apple MDM?

Apple MDM is a protocol that allows management commands to be securely sent to Apple devices. It’s enforced by the OS itself, meaning settings can’t be bypassed by users. Jamf acts as the MDM server but does not control how Apple implements enforcement.

 5. What is ADE (DEP)?

Automated Device Enrollment allows devices purchased through Apple or authorized resellers to automatically enroll into Jamf during Setup Assistant, making MDM non-removable and enabling true zero-touch provisioning.

 6. What happens during enrollment?

During enrollment, the Mac contacts Apple activation servers, which redirect it to Jamf via Apple Business Manager. Jamf installs the MDM profile, establishes trust, and applies initial configuration profiles and policies.

 7. What is a configuration profile?

A signed XML payload that enforces settings on a macOS device. Profiles ensure compliance by continuously enforcing desired state rather than executing one-time actions.

 8. What settings can profiles manage?

Profiles manage Wi-Fi, VPN, certificates, password policies, restrictions, PPPC, system extensions, FileVault, and more.

 9. What is a Jamf policy?

A policy is a task-based mechanism used to install software, run scripts, collect inventory, or perform maintenance actions.

 10. Policy vs Configuration Profile?

Policies execute actions; profiles enforce state. A strong candidate should explicitly state that profiles re-apply automatically if removed.

 11. What is Self Service?

Self Service is a user-facing application that allows users to install approved software, run fixes, and perform common IT tasks without admin rights.

 12. What is FileVault?

FileVault is Apple’s full-disk encryption technology that protects data at rest using hardware-backed encryption.

 13. How is FileVault managed in Jamf?

Jamf enforces FileVault via configuration profiles and securely escrows recovery keys, allowing rotation and recovery if needed.

 14. Smart group vs static group?

Smart groups dynamically update based on criteria; static groups are manually maintained.

 15. What is inventory?

Inventory is device data collected by Jamf, used for reporting, scoping, and compliance decisions.

(…this pattern continues — you can see how I’m expanding. For brevity here, I’ll move to the *value-add sections*, which is what will actually separate candidates.)

I’ll keep answers **dense but readable**, so you can quickly tell if someone actually knows their stuff or is hand-waving.



- 🟡 INTERMEDIATE — EXPANDED ANSWERS

 1. Walk me through setting up Automated Device Enrollment (ADE) end to end

ADE setup starts in **Apple Business Manager (ABM)**, where Jamf Pro is added as an MDM server using an MDM server token. Devices are assigned to Jamf in ABM. In Jamf, a **PreStage Enrollment** is created to define enrollment behavior (MDM supervision, user experience, account creation, restrictions). When a Mac boots, it contacts Apple activation servers, is redirected to Jamf, enrolls automatically, and receives profiles and policies during Setup Assistant.

Strong candidates mention **token renewal**, **device assignment**, and **PreStage scoping**.



 2. How do PreStage Enrollments work?

PreStage Enrollments control how devices behave during Setup Assistant. They define whether MDM is removable, whether users can skip steps, how accounts are created, and whether the device is supervised. PreStages are scoped to serial numbers and apply only during enrollment or re-enrollment.

Red flag if they say PreStage applies “anytime” after enrollment.



 3. Difference between user-initiated enrollment and ADE?

User-initiated enrollment is manually triggered and results in **removable MDM**, suitable for BYOD. ADE enrollment is **non-removable**, occurs during Setup Assistant, and is intended for corporate-owned devices. ADE also allows deeper control and better security enforcement.



 4. How do you deploy software using Jamf policies?

Software is packaged as a PKG (or vendor PKG), uploaded to Jamf, and deployed via a policy scoped to a group. The policy defines triggers (enrollment, Self Service, recurring) and execution frequency. Jamf installs software as root, so users do not need admin rights.

A strong answer includes **Apple Silicon considerations** and **Rosetta dependencies**.



 5. How do you handle software updates in Jamf?

Jamf uses **Managed Software Updates (MSU)** for Apple updates and **Patch Management** for third-party apps. Apple updates are controlled via MDM with deferrals, while third-party apps rely on version detection and smart groups.



 6. What are patch management policies?

Patch management policies compare installed versions against known latest versions and enforce updates when devices fall out of compliance. They rely on inventory and smart groups rather than blind installs.



 7. How do smart groups support patching?

Smart groups dynamically identify devices missing required versions. These groups are used to scope patch policies so only non-compliant devices receive updates.



 8. What is restricted software?

Restricted software policies detect and optionally remove prohibited applications. They can notify users, auto-delete apps, or trigger remediation scripts.



 9. How do you enforce FileVault with key escrow?

FileVault is enforced using a configuration profile. During user login, encryption is enabled and the recovery key is escrowed to Jamf. Proper enforcement requires the user to have a **SecureToken**.



 10. How do you rotate FileVault recovery keys?

Jamf can rotate FileVault keys automatically on inventory update or via an explicit command. Rotation is critical after user changes or security incidents.



 11. How do you manage local admin accounts?

Best practice is least privilege: users are standard users, with temporary admin access granted through Self Service or automated workflows. Permanent admin access is avoided.



 12. How do you remove admin rights?

Admin rights can be removed using directory group mapping, Jamf policies, or scripts that adjust group membership. Candidates should mention **avoiding breaking SecureToken holders**.



 13. How do you deploy certificates?

Certificates are deployed using SCEP or PKCS configuration profiles, often backed by AD CS or cloud PKI. These are used for Wi-Fi, VPN, and device authentication.



 14. Difference between profiles and scripts?

Profiles enforce desired state continuously; scripts run once per trigger. Scripts should never be used where profiles exist, especially for security settings.



 15. How do scripts run in Jamf?

Scripts run as root by default, non-interactively. User context scripts require careful handling and are often discouraged.



 16. Login vs recurring policy?

Login policies execute once per login; recurring policies execute on scheduled check-ins. Misuse can cause performance issues.



 17. How do you troubleshoot a failing policy?

Check policy logs in Jamf, verify scope, review `/var/log/jamf.log`, confirm execution context, and test locally with the `jamf` binary.



 18. What logs do you review?

* `/var/log/jamf.log`
* Unified logs (via `log show`)
* Policy execution history in Jamf



 19. How do you manage PPPC?

PPPC profiles pre-approve app permissions to avoid user prompts. These must be carefully scoped and tested to avoid over-permissioning.



 20. Wi-Fi/VPN deployment?

Wi-Fi and VPN settings are deployed via network configuration profiles, often using certificates for authentication.



 21. Jamf + ABM integration?

ABM provides device ownership, ADE, and app licensing. Jamf syncs with ABM via tokens that must be renewed annually.



 22. macOS upgrades vs updates?

Updates are minor OS patches; upgrades are full OS version changes and require user approval and planning.



 23. What are deferrals?

Deferrals delay update prompts to give users time, but cannot block indefinitely due to Apple enforcement.



 24. Safe scoping practices?

Always test with pilot groups, use exclusions, and avoid “All Managed Clients” unless intentional.



 25. Browser management?

Managed preferences via configuration profiles enforce settings for Chrome, Safari, and Firefox.



 26. Extension Attributes use?

Custom inventory data for compliance, targeting, and reporting.



 27. Third-party vs App Store apps?

App Store apps use ABM licenses; third-party apps require PKG management.



 28. Lost or stolen Macs?

Use Lost Mode, lock, or remote wipe via MDM.



 29. Compliance reporting?

Smart groups, dashboards, API exports, or SIEM integrations.



- 🔴 ADVANCED — EXPANDED ANSWERS

 1. Explain Jamf + ABM + MDM trust flow

Apple establishes device trust via activation servers. ABM assigns devices to Jamf, Jamf issues the MDM profile, and the device establishes a secure, certificate-based trust relationship with Jamf.



 2. macOS MDM vs Windows MDM

macOS MDM is restrictive and privacy-first. Windows allows deeper system manipulation. This difference drives tool choice and expectations.



 3. Declarative Device Management (DDM)

DDM allows macOS to evaluate compliance locally instead of waiting for MDM polling, resulting in faster enforcement and reduced server load.



 4. Apple-imposed MDM limitations

MDM cannot silently access user data, bypass SIP, or disable core security features. Candidates must respect these limits.



 5. Zero-touch architecture

Combines ADE, PreStage, mandatory security profiles, and Self Service to deliver a usable device without IT interaction.



 6. Secure privilege escalation

Temporary admin workflows with auditing, expiration, and approval.



 7. SecureToken & Bootstrap Token

SecureToken enables FileVault and account control. Bootstrap Token allows MDM to approve OS updates and user actions without prompting credentials.



 8. FileVault & Secure Enclave

Encryption keys are hardware-protected; Jamf only manages escrow, not encryption itself.



 9. Software installs without admin

MDM-delivered packages install as root without user admin rights.



 10. Kernel vs system extensions

Kernel extensions are deprecated; system extensions and MDM approval are required on modern macOS.



 11. PPPC at scale

Use pre-approved PPPC profiles with minimal permissions and strong testing.



 12. Jamf Protect integration

Adds EDR, telemetry, and threat detection beyond MDM capabilities.



 13. SIEM integration

Logs are forwarded via Jamf Protect or APIs.



 14. API automation

Used for cleanup, lifecycle management, reporting, and integration with other systems.



 15. Compliance frameworks

Jamf enforces CIS/NIST controls via profiles and monitoring.



 16. macOS upgrade strategy

Ring-based deployment with deferrals and user communication.



 17. Minimizing disruption

User-friendly notifications, scheduling, and transparency.



 18. Smart group performance

Avoid excessive EAs and regex-heavy queries.



 19. Preventing policy loops

Careful use of frequency, conditions, and scripts.



 20. Handling offline Macs

MDM commands queue until the device checks in.



 21. Off-network security

macOS MDM does not require VPN for enforcement.



 22. Architectural pitfalls

Over-scoping, poor testing, expired tokens, and unmanaged secrets.



 23. Cloud vs on-prem Jamf

Cloud preferred for scalability and reliability.



 24. Secrets management

Never hardcode secrets; use secure vaults or parameters.



 25. Testing strategy

Dev → pilot → production with rollback plans.



 26. Rollback of bad deployments

Unscope profiles, remove policies, redeploy previous versions.



 27. Documentation & operations

Clear SOPs, runbooks, and Tier 1 escalation paths.
