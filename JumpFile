Advance Modern Management, Automation, and Operational Maturity

🧱 Roadmap Pillars

Your items naturally group into 4 strategic pillars. This is important — leadership thinks in pillars, not bullets.

Pillar A — Modern Management & Zero Trust

(Items 1, 3, 8)

Pillar B — Automation & Operational Efficiency

(Items 2, 5)

Pillar C — Application & Platform Rationalization

(Items 4)

Pillar D — Visibility, Insights & Security Posture

(Items 6, 7)

🗓️ Phased Roadmap View
Phase 1: Foundation & Enablement (Q1–Q2)

“Fix fundamentals, remove dependencies, enable scale”

Key Initiatives

Expand Zero Trust posture via:

Entra Join

Conditional Access

Compliance policies

Begin BitLocker key migration from on-prem AD to Entra ID / Intune

Define WinGet automation standards and pilot third-party app updates

Baseline Task Sequence images and identify redundant applications

Outcomes

Reduced dependency on IAM teams

Improved device security posture

Faster, cleaner provisioning foundation

Phase 2: Automation & Optimization (Q2–Q3)

“Reduce manual effort and operational noise”

Key Initiatives

Scale WinGet automation to target 40% reduction in manual packaging

Streamline Task Sequences:

Remove redundant applications

Improve imaging time and device performance

Partner with Application Teams & SMEs to:

Identify unused applications

Decommission low-value software

Outcomes

Measurable reduction in EUC operational effort

Smaller application footprint

Faster imaging and reduced patching overhead

Phase 3: Visibility, Insights & Security Maturity (Q3–Q4)

“Move from reactive operations to data-driven decisions”

Key Initiatives

Implement Power BI dashboards integrated with SCCM & Intune:

Device health

Compliance

Deployment success

Establish a vulnerability management framework:

Prioritization model

Faster remediation cycles

Continuous posture improvement

Outcomes

Automated reporting replaces manual weekly effort

Clear visibility into fleet health and risk

Improved audit and leadership reporting readiness

Phase 4: Platform Convergence & Future Readiness (Q4+)

“Reduce tool sprawl and prepare for next-gen EUC”

Key Initiatives

Begin Jamf → Intune migration:

Scope definition

Pilot groups

Platform parity assessment

Align cross-platform management strategy under Intune

Outcomes

Simplified management stack

Reduced licensing and operational complexity

Clear long-term endpoint platform direction
