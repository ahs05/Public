**Subject:** Windows 11 Migration – Communication Summary and Follow-Up

Hi \[Manager's Name],

As discussed during our Windows 11 Migration weekly meeting on June 4th, please find attached the list of initial and follow-up emails that were sent to the Business Unit/Department Heads and Line Managers.

**Key Details:**

* The Business Unit Heads/Leads information was provided by Dcan and is included in the attached document.
* Refer to the file **"Tactical Approach.msg"** for details on how we gathered the Line Managers’ information.
* The attached spreadsheet **("Responded vs Non-Responded.xls")** summarizes who has responded to our emails and who has not, along with the dates for each initial and follow-up communication.

I’ll also be sending out a meeting invite shortly so we can discuss this further.
Please let me know if you have any questions or need additional information.

Best regards,
\[Your Name]
\[Your Position]
