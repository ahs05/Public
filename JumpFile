Hi Team,

Just wanted to share a quick update regarding a new method we've successfully implemented for managing OS drivers during OSD.

Last week, we were able to successfully apply drivers during OSD on a **Dell Latitude 5420** using **Package Objects** in SCCM. This method replaces the traditional use of 'Driver Packages' and brings with it some significant benefits.

I've created a **step-by-step documentation** outlining the process of applying Windows OS drivers via Task Sequence Imaging using Package Objects in SCCM. This is intended to help anyone managing or creating drivers in SCCM follow this streamlined approach.

I've already provided a walkthrough of the documentation to **David Holmes**, who is currently reviewing it. The plan is to test this process on additional Dell models to validate and strengthen the approach.

This method has been used and recommended widely across the SCCM community and by several MVPs. It helped me manage driver deployment during OSD for over **25 Dell models** in a previous environment with **60K devices**. Beyond simplifying management, it also significantly reduces the time required to import drivers (from 40–50 minutes using Driver Packages to just 10–15 minutes with Package Objects).

We’re proposing a **Crawl-Walk-Run** strategy—starting with at least 10 Dell models on the Win11 Task Sequence. If the results continue to be promising, we can adopt this method as our primary and begin transitioning away from traditional Driver Packages.

Happy to review this with **Joe** and **Sujith** for approvals, if needed.

Let me know if there are any questions or feedback!

Best regards,

Subject: Proposal to Transition Driver Management to SCCM Package Objects

Hi Team,

I hope this message finds you well.

I wanted to share a recent update regarding driver management during OSD. Last week, we successfully applied drivers during deployment on a Dell Latitude 5420 using Package Objects in SCCM, moving away from the traditional 'Driver Packages' approach.

To support this, I’ve put together a detailed step-by-step guide on applying Windows OS drivers during Task Sequence imaging using Package Objects in SCCM. This documentation is now available for internal reference.

A brief walkthrough was shared with David Holmes, who is currently reviewing the process. Pending his feedback, we plan to test the approach on additional Dell models to further validate its effectiveness.

This method has been widely recognized in the SCCM community and recommended by several industry MVPs. I previously leveraged it between 2018 and 2020 across 25 Dell models for an environment of over 60,000 devices. Notably, this model significantly reduces driver import times—from 40–50 minutes (Driver Packages) to 10–15 minutes (Package Objects, with OEM media).

As a next step, I propose we follow a Crawl-Walk-Run model and implement this approach across at least 10 Dell models on our Win11 Task Sequence. Upon successful evaluation, we can consider this our primary method and gradually phase out our use of Driver Packages.

If needed, we can present this to Joe and Sujith for formal approval.

Please don’t hesitate to reach out with any questions or feedback.

Best regards,
