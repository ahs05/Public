**Subject:** Request for Review & Sign-Off on UAT Comms and Target List

Hi @Zoch II, Joseph P.,

As discussed, as part of our tactical approach, we’d like to send the attached communications to the Reporting/Line Managers from the Legacy ACG branches.

We’re aiming to align these Reporting/Line Managers as UAT testers for our May 30th weekend deployment. Additionally, we’re requesting their support in nominating a few users who could serve as Pilot Testers for the June 6th weekend deployment. This approach will better position our EDM team for a successful production deployment on June 13th.

Looking ahead, we plan to apply a similar approach across other business units and departments as well.

From the Master List, I’ve cherry-picked the top reporting managers with the highest number of users under them.

Could you please review the attached \[**Comms**] and the **Target User-Device List**, and provide your sign-off?

Please feel free to update or modify the comms as needed.

Best regards,
\[Your Name]
