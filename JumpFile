Proposed Persona-Driven Device Provisioning Architecture

Overview
We propose leveraging Active Directory Extension Attributes to define and manage user personas that drive consistent, automated application deployment across both SCCM and Intune.

These attributes act as a single source of truth for role-based provisioning and replicate seamlessly from On-Prem AD to Entra ID.

Persona Attribute Strategy

Populate persona-related AD Extension Attributes via ServiceNow-approved requests

Attributes are governed, standardized, and read-only during imaging

Persona data replicates to Entra ID for cloud-based provisioning

Usage in SCCM (Imaging & Task Sequences)

During imaging, SCCM reads persona attributes directly from AD

Persona is displayed for visibility, not selected by technicians

Task Sequences dynamically install application bundles based on persona

EDM team maintains centralized persona-to-app logic

Benefits

Eliminates manual app selection

Reduces imaging errors

Ensures consistent builds

Usage in Intune (Autopilot & ESP)

Persona attributes replicated to Entra ID

Dynamic Entra ID Groups created per persona

Required applications assigned to persona-based groups

Apps install automatically during Autopilot ESP

Benefits

Zero-touch provisioning

Role-based application delivery

Scalable and cloud-aligned

Key Outcomes

Single persona definition used across SCCM and Intune

Reduced technician dependency

Improved auditability and compliance
