**Subject:** Enable Security Copilot Agents in Lab Tenant

Hi [Global Admin Name],

Hope you’re doing well!

Microsoft recently released **Security Copilot Agents in Intune**, including:

1. Change Review Agent
2. Policy Configuration Agent
3. Vulnerability Remediation Agent
4. Device Offboarding Agent

Could we get Security Copilot **enabled in our lab tenant** so we can do a quick pre-walkthrough of these agents? This will help us test functionality, evaluate workflows, and prepare for production rollout.

We’ll need:

* SCU allocation / Security Copilot license
* Security Copilot Administrator role in Entra ID
* RBAC and Defender access for admin accounts

Appreciate your help in getting this set up — this will let us safely test before production.

Thanks so much!
Ari K.

If you want, I can also make an **ultra-short one-paragraph version** that’s even snappier for Teams chat. Do you want me to do that?
