Heads-Up: SCCM Upgrade & Imaging Freeze – 01/16/2026
Action Required: SCCM Upgrade – Imaging Freeze on Friday, 01/16/2026
Hello Team,

This is to inform you that an SCCM upgrade is scheduled for Friday, January 16, 2026.

To ensure a smooth and risk-free upgrade, please adhere to the following timeline:

All imaging activities must be completed by end of day Thursday, January 15, 2026, preferably by 7:00 PM ET.

Please do not image any workstations on Friday, January 16, 2026, as SCCM pre-upgrade activities (including backups and other preparatory tasks) will begin on Friday morning. This is to avoid any potential impact during the upgrade window.

Additional information:

The SCCM Admin Console installed on workstations used by L1, L2, and L3 teams will be automatically updated as part of this upgrade.

When you log back into the SCCM Admin Console after the upgrade (next business day), the console will already be updated.

No user interaction is required from your side.

If there are any further updates or announcements, we will be sure to keep your teams informed.

Thank you for your cooperation and support.
