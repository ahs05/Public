### **Discussion Points & Updates**  

1. **Windows 11 24H2 GPO Discussion**  
   - Jeff met with the Microsoft representative regarding GPO topics for Windows 11 24H2.  
   - He is still encountering challenges related to DeviceIDs for USB devices.  

2. **23H2 vs. 24H2 Decision**  
   - The ACG team reviewed the differences between Windows 11 23H2 and 24H2.  
   - The team decided to proceed with 24H2 as the NetDomain join issue appears to be resolvable.  
   - GPO settings will remain a challenge for both versions.  
   - Given Windows 10â€™s upcoming end-of-support, Microsoft may release Windows 11 25H1, making 24H2 a more viable option.  

3. **Application Owner Testing**  
   - Jeff provided the EDM team with a go-ahead (not a formal sign-off) to begin application owner testing.  
   - The plan includes imaging a few training lab PCs post-Phase 1 testing.  
   - Application owners will be requested to RDP into these machines to perform functionality testing.  
   - A formalized plan for app owner testing needs to be drafted.  

4. **CIM Track Application Compliance**  
   - Jeff informed the team that the CIM Track Application currently lacks the functionality to scan Windows devices against the 24H2 CIS Benchmark baseline settings.  
   - The team is actively working on addressing this gap.  

5. **Corner Case Documentation**  
   - All identified corner cases need to be documented and reviewed at a later stage.  

6. **GPO Issue Tracking**  
   - Any GPO settings causing functional issues with Windows 11 24H2 should be documented.  
   - Issues should be forwarded to Shaun & Jeff for review and resolution.
