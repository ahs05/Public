**Subject:** Nomination Request for Windows 11 Upgrade Pilot – Monday, June 2 at 7 PM ET

Hi Margret,

Thank you for sending us the list of users.

Would it be possible for you to nominate at least **2–3 users** from this list to participate in the **Windows 11 upgrade pilot scheduled for Monday, June 2 at 7:00 PM ET**?

We’ll ensure that all necessary communications and deployment timelines are clearly shared. Our EDM team members and Hypercare support personnel will be available 24x7 to assist with any questions or issues your team may encounter during the process.

As part of this pilot, we’d like to observe the **first-time launch behavior of ImageRight** following a successful upgrade.

Our goal is to deploy the upgrade to the remaining users on **Friday, June 6**, based on the success of Monday’s deployment.

Please note that there is **no rollback option** once the upgrade is complete—users will remain on Windows 11. So far, we’ve successfully upgraded around 100 devices without any issues. The Workspot Client remains available for testing as needed.

If you need any updates or further information from our end, please don’t hesitate to reach out. We’ll keep you and your team informed throughout the process.

Best regards,
\[Your Name]
\[Your Role/Team Name]
\[Contact Information, if needed]
