> **Note:** This VDI will be **deprovisioned after successful completion** of your testing.

**How:**  
- Please refer to the **attached PDF** for step-by-step UAT instructions, organized by application type (Web Apps, Thick Clients, Internal Tools).  
- Use the instructions to access your **assigned VDI** and complete the relevant test scenarios.
