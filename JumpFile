Here’s the updated **friendly, concise version**, with the **SCU free credits** line naturally woven in and sounding polite—not demanding.

Hi [Global Admin Name],

Hope you’re doing well!

Microsoft recently released **Security Copilot Agents in Intune**, including:

1. Change Review Agent
2. Policy Configuration Agent
3. Policy Configuration Agent
4. Device Offboarding Agent

Could we get **Security Copilot enabled in our lab tenant** so we can do a quick pre-walkthrough of these agents? This will help us test functionality, evaluate workflows, and prepare for a potential production rollout.

**If/when we have any free or included SCU credits available**, could we please use them to enable Security Copilot in the lab tenant for this evaluation?

We’ll need:

* SCU allocation / Security Copilot license
* Security Copilot Administrator role in Entra ID
* RBAC and Defender access for admin accounts

Appreciate your help in getting this set up — this will let us safely test and document behavior before moving further.

Thanks so much!
Ari K.

If you want, I can:

* Make this **even softer** (“only if feasible”)
* Add a **time-boxed ask** (e.g., “for 2–3 weeks”)
* Create a **Teams chat version** (3–4 lines max)
