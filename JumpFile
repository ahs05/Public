Hi Team,

I hope you’re doing well. This is my first time reaching out to the Networking team, and I’m looking forward to collaborating with you on an imaging issue we are currently investigating.

**Background**
We are seeing intermittent PXE/imaging failures with the **Dell Pro 14 PB250** model. Based on our internal review and vendor guidance, the boot image storage and network drivers appear healthy. However, there is an indication that network conditions at Layer 2 (potentially older switching paths or longer cable runs at imaging locations) may be contributing to the behavior.

**Request for Networking Support**
To help us validate or rule out the network as a factor, we would appreciate your assistance with packet-level analysis during the PXE/imaging process. Specifically, if you could help review:

* DHCP/PXE handshake behavior
* TFTP transfer stability
* Packet loss or retransmissions
* Any observable Layer 2 drops or anomalies along the imaging path

If feasible, Wireshark captures and/or switch-level analysis from the imaging VLAN/path would be extremely helpful.

**Next Steps**
We are happy to coordinate controlled repro tests and can provide affected device details, imaging locations, and preferred test windows.

Please let me know the best way to partner on this and any prerequisites you would like from our side.

Appreciate your support and looking forward to working together.

Thanks,
Harish
