Good clarification.
This changes the positioning significantly.

This is not “automation at scale.”
This is **operational containment + cost avoidance + L1/L2 empowerment.**

Let’s craft this properly — Tower Lead level, but factually accurate.

## **Challenge**

### Zscaler FW/AV Error Causing Egress Traffic Block

A recurring Zscaler FW/AV agent issue was blocking outbound (egress) traffic on affected devices, resulting in complete loss of connectivity.

**Operational Impact:**

* Users unable to access internet / SaaS applications
* High-priority ServiceNow incidents
* Limited visibility to proactively detect impacted endpoints
* Manual troubleshooting cycles
* Devices often misdiagnosed as hardware/network failures

**Pre-Implementation Reality:**

* No standardized remediation method
* Escalations to engineering
* In several cases, devices were replaced
* Increased operational cost and downtime

---

## **Strategic Action Taken**

### Standardized Remediation Model (Microsoft + Intune)

* Opened a joint investigation with Microsoft
* Received validated remediation script from Microsoft Support
* Engineered and operationalized the fix via **Intune Proactive Remediation**

**Execution Framework Built:**

* Converted Microsoft script into controlled remediation package
* Validated safe execution model
* Centralized logging for traceability
* Scoped execution on-demand via Intune

### Operational Empowerment Model

Since no proactive detection mechanism exists:

* Remediation is triggered upon incident creation
* Provided RBAC rights to L1 / L2 technicians
* Enabled frontline teams to execute remediation directly
* Eliminated dependency on engineering escalation

---

## **Operational & Business Outcomes**

### Immediate Improvements

* Significant reduction in device replacements
* Faster incident resolution (reduced MTTR)
* Standardized troubleshooting path
* Reduced engineering escalations
* Improved Service Desk confidence

### Cost & Risk Avoidance

* Prevented unnecessary hardware refresh
* Reduced downtime for impacted users
* Improved egress traffic stability

---

## **Strategic EDM Tower Impact**

* Converted recurring connectivity issue into governed remediation workflow
* Strengthened cross-functional collaboration (EUC + Microsoft)
* Improved incident response maturity
* Reduced reactive engineering burden
* Increased endpoint recovery success rate

---

### Executive Positioning Statement

> “Transformed a recurring Zscaler connectivity failure from device replacement-driven resolution to a standardized, L1-executable remediation model — reducing cost, downtime, and escalation dependency.”

If you'd like, I can now:

* Make it more metric-driven (with realistic KPI placeholders)
* Align it to your Automation & Operational Efficiency roadmap pillar
* Or compress it into tighter executive slide bullets (if space is limited)

This version positions you correctly as Tower Lead — not script writer, but operational stabilizer.
