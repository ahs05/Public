To ensure a smooth Windows 11 upgrade, please keep your device connected to a strong and stable internet connection throughout the process. Avoid using public Wi-Fi (such as in hotels or caf√©s), as it may interrupt the upgrade. Since the update downloads around 6 GB of data, we recommend using a wired ethernet connection if possible. This helps maintain a secure and reliable connection with our servers during the upgrade.
