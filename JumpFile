**Subject:** Finalized Visual Rollout Matrix & Official Production Deployment Date

Hi @Enterprise Desktop Management,

I wanted to provide a quick update that the dates outlined in the Visual Rollout Matrix spreadsheet have now been finalized. Additionally, the Production rollout plan has been reviewed and approved by ACG.

**June 16, 2025** has been confirmed as the official date for our first Production deployment. TCS leadership, in coordination with the Windows 11 Project Team, has requested that all EDM Engineers and associated stakeholders adhere to this timeline. This includes completing all necessary deliverables prior to the deployment dateâ€”such as the Pilot phase, Early Adopter onboarding, and UAT testing of Windows 11.

Please ensure your teams are aligned with the finalized plan and are working toward meeting the key milestones accordingly.

An offline copy of the finalized Visual Rollout Matrix is attached to this email for your reference.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further clarification.

Best regards,
\[Your Name]
\[Your Title or Team, if applicable]
