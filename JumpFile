## **1. Project Overview**  
As part of ACG’s cloud-first strategy, TCS will lead the initiative to define and implement **Persona-based endpoint management** using **Intune and Entra-only** deployment. This project will standardize IT provisioning, automate onboarding/offboarding, and enhance security while supporting ACG’s transition away from on-premises solutions (Active Directory, SCCM).

- Align Personas with **business functions and IT requirements** (devices, apps, security policies).  

✅ **Device & Application Deployment Strategy**  
- Define **Persona-based device provisioning** using **Intune & Autopilot**.  
- Map applications to Personas and establish **dynamic software deployment policies**.  
- Assess feasibility of shifting **on-prem apps to cloud/browser-based alternatives**.  

✅ **Automation & Integration**  
- Workday → ServiceNow → Intune integration for **automated onboarding & offboarding**.  
- Define workflows for **automating Persona-based group assignment** in Entra & Intune.  

✅ **Security & Compliance Alignment**

- Any major licensing shifts (e.g., Microsoft 365, ServiceNow API changes) are outside this project's scope.  

🚫 **HR Policy or Organizational Restructuring**  
- While Workday integration will be explored, changes to **HR policies or roles** are not part of this project.
