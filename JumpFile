Subject: Friendly Reminder: SCCM Site Upgrade & Imaging Freeze

Hello Team,

Just a friendly reminder regarding the upcoming **SCCM Site Upgrade scheduled for Friday, January 16, 2026**.

We have already received confirmation that imaging will be stopped on Friday — thank you for that. As a final reminder, please ensure **all imaging activities are completed by end of day Thursday, January 15, 2026 (preferably by 7:00 PM ET)**.
There should be **no workstation imaging on Friday, January 16, 2026**, during the upgrade window.

We appreciate your cooperation and support in helping make this upgrade smooth and successful. A confirmation will be shared once the upgrade is complete.

Thank you!

Best regards,
Ari K.
