At an organizational level, one potential approach could be to leverage the Zscaler Admin Console to identify devices reporting Zscaler FW/AV errors and dynamically place those affected systems into a dedicated AD group.

This would allow us to clearly scope only impacted devices, especially since we currently do not have a reliable method to determine FW/AV issues across all systems and want to avoid impacting unaffected endpoints.

With this in place, we could then target an Intune Proactive Remediation to that AD group and have the script run on a scheduled (daily) basis.
