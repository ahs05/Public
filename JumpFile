# **Meeting Notes: Future State of Endpoint Management**  
**Date:** [Insert Date]  
**Attendees:** [Your Name], [Manager's Name]  

## **Key Discussion Points:**  

### **Long-Term Vision: Transition to Entra-Only & Cloud-Based Management**  
- The future strategy involves moving towards an **Entra-only** environment, eliminating reliance on traditional **on-premises solutions** like Active Directory (AD) and **SCCM**.  
- The current infrastructure was built for an on-premises workforce, but the modern work environment is now **predominantly remote (50-60% or more)**, necessitating a shift to cloud-based management.  
- **Autopilot deployment** will replace **task sequences**, with devices receiving configurations dynamically based on **tags (user/device group tags)** instead of predefined images.  

### **Personas & Application Management Strategy**  
- **Defining and identifying Personas** is critical to ensuring that the right applications and configurations are deployed efficiently.  
- Personas will not be **shrunk** but rather **expanded** based on business needs, including categories like **Contact Center (Insurance, Claims, Membership, Travel) and Back Office roles**.  
- Applications will be delivered **dynamically**, ideally reducing the footprint on devices by shifting to **browser-based applications** where possible.  

### **Automation & Integration Strategy**  
- The goal is to automate **onboarding and offboarding** processes.  
- Future-state workflow vision:  
  1. **HR system (Workday)** triggers API calls to **ServiceNow**.  
  2. **ServiceNow** provisions the device, assigns groups, and manages user access.  
  3. **Orchestrator** feeds the necessary configurations into **Intune**, ensuring seamless policy and application deployment.  
- SCCM will still be fine-tuned where necessary, but **Intune is the primary direction forward**.  

### **Next Steps & Action Items**  
1. **Start defining Personas** and mapping application needs in **Intune**.  
2. Begin testing **an Entra-only build** with available resources.  
3. Explore **automation options** for provisioning and device management workflows.  
4. Evaluate **Workday â†’ ServiceNow â†’ Intune integration** for user provisioning.

- **Subtitle:** *TCSâ€™ Approach to Driving Change and Enabling a Cloud-First Strategy*  
- **Presented by:** [Your Name]  
- **Date:** [Mondayâ€™s Date]  

---

## **2. Introduction & Objective**  
### **Why Personas Matter?**  
- Shift towards **Entra-only, cloud-first** IT strategy.  
- Need to tailor **device provisioning, access, and applications** to different employee groups.  
- **Business & IT Alignment:** Understanding workforce needs for efficient IT delivery.

---

## **3. Current State & Challenges**  
### **Current Endpoint Management Landscape at ACG**  
- **On-Prem Legacy Model:** Dependency on **Active Directory (AD), SCCM**, and task sequences.  
- **Remote Work Challenges:** 50-60% of employees work remotely, requiring **cloud-based solutions**.  
- **Application Delivery Complexity:** Traditional **predefined images** vs. dynamic persona-based deployment.  
- **Manual Onboarding/Offboarding:** Lack of automation, leading to inefficiencies.  

**Key Challenge:** How do we transition from a static, on-prem model to a **dynamic, cloud-first** model with **Personas-based provisioning**?  

---

## **4. TCSâ€™ Approach to Defining Personas**  
### **Step 1: Identifying Personas at ACG**  
- **Personas are role-based classifications** that determine IT requirements (devices, apps, access).  
- TCS proposes a **structured framework** for defining Personas:  

| **Persona Category** | **Sub-Categories** | **Device Needs** | **Application Needs** | **Access & Security** |  
|---------------------|------------------|------------------|----------------------|---------------------|  
| **Frontline Workers** | Call Center, Claims, Membership, Travel | Lightweight devices | Cloud-based apps, VDI | Restricted access |  
| **Corporate Office** | Finance, HR, IT, Legal | Standard laptops | Microsoft 365, ERP | Role-based security |  
| **Developers & Engineers** | IT, Cloud, DevOps | High-performance devices | Dev tools, cloud environments | Elevated permissions |  
| **Field & Remote Workers** | Insurance Agents, Sales | Mobile-first devices | Secure VPN, CRM | Conditional access |  

---

### **Step 2: Aligning Personas with IT Deployment Strategy**  
- **Autopilot & Intune for Zero-Touch Deployment:** Devices configured based on **Persona tags**.  
- **Application Packaging Strategy:**  
  - Cloud-first applications â†’ **Web-based where possible**.  
  - **Device-specific apps** delivered dynamically via **Intune & Entra groups**.  
- **Security Considerations:**  
  - Conditional access based on **Persona risk profile**.  
  - Least privilege model: **Restrict admin rights by Persona needs**.
