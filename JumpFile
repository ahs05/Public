   It‚Äôs web-based (similar to Outlook.com), with a modern UI and faster updates‚Äîbut it lacks some enterprise features found in the classic desktop version.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Advisory: Use Outlook (Classic) Instead of ‚ÄúNew Outlook‚Äù on Windows 11

Dear Team,

Microsoft has introduced a **‚ÄúNew Outlook‚Äù** app as part of Windows 11 updates and via Microsoft Store. While it features a modern look and integration with Microsoft 365, it currently lacks many key functionalities that are critical in our environment.

#### üõë What You Should Do:

**Please continue using the Outlook (Classic) desktop application** wherever possible.

#### ‚ùó Why We Recommend This:

* The *New Outlook* does **not support** certain enterprise features like:

  * COM add-ins and certain plug-ins
  * PST files and archived mail (limited support)
  * POP accounts
  * Full offline access
  * Advanced rules and Quick Steps
  * Trusted email/security settings
* It also routes all mail accounts (including Gmail, Yahoo, etc.) through Microsoft‚Äôs servers.

#### ‚úÖ What We Support:

* Outlook (Classic) from the Microsoft 365 Apps suite remains the recommended and fully supported email client in our environment.

#### ‚ÑπÔ∏è If You've Already Switched:

If you've already enabled the *New Outlook*, you can switch back by turning off the **‚ÄúTry the new Outlook‚Äù** toggle at the top-right corner of the window.
