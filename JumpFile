Here’s a **clean, professional, and clear email** with leadership tone, corrected wording, and logical flow:
Action Required: Self-Appraisal Submission in SPEED (Ultimatix) – Due Jan 15
Hello Team,

I have been asked to remind everyone regarding the **Self-Appraisal assessment in SPEED (Ultimatix)**.

As per **TCS guidelines**, we are currently in the **final quarter**, and **self-appraisals must be submitted by January 15**. Please note that **if the self-appraisal is not submitted by the due date, the system will place you in the default group and automatically assign a rating (UPI)**.

To avoid last-minute issues, we strongly recommend **not waiting until the final day**, as the SPEED portal may experience **heavy usage and performance delays** closer to the deadline.

**Important prerequisites for completing your Self-Appraisal:**

* **SDC Compliance**
* **ADC Compliance**

If you have not completed these already, please make every effort to **close them by tomorrow or as early as possible**, as they are mandatory to proceed with the appraisal submission.

For any questions or assistance related to this process, please:

* Reach out to **Noor**, or
* Raise a **GHD ticket via TCS Ultimatix**

Thank you for your cooperation and timely action.

Best regards,
Ari K

If you want, I can also provide a **short reminder version** or a **more directive escalation-style version**.

Here’s a **polished, professional email** based on your content, with clarity, leadership tone, and proper justification filled in:

Hello Team,

Attached is the **list of systems that require replacement at the earliest**.

Based on reports from **SCCM and Intune/Autopatch**, these systems have **not been receiving Windows monthly security patches for an extended period of time**. As a result, they are consistently failing patch compliance and are **negatively impacting our overall compliance metrics**.

Please note that the **EDM team has already completed due diligence** on these devices. This includes extensive troubleshooting of failed Windows Updates following **industry best practices**. Despite these efforts, the issues persist and are not recoverable through standard remediation.

While the list includes both **Windows 10 and Windows 11 devices**, we have collectively agreed to **prioritize the replacement of Windows 10 systems first** for the following reasons:

* These devices have been **in the replacement queue for an extended period**
* They **do not meet the minimum hardware requirements for Windows 11**
* Continued use poses an **ongoing compliance and security risk**

We would appreciate it if the replacement of these systems could be **completed at the earliest possible timeframe** to help restore patch compliance and reduce audit risk.

Please let us know if additional information or coordination is required from our side.

Thank you for your support and cooperation.

Best regards,
Ari K

If you want, I can also provide:

* a **more firm/escalation-ready version**, or
* a **short executive summary version** for leadership threads.
