Here’s a **polished, leadership-ready email** that is **fact-based, risk-focused, and follows chain of command**, without sounding accusatory. I’ve filled gaps where appropriate and kept it professional.

Hi [Leadership Team / Recipient Names],

I am writing to formally raise and seek guidance on a **known gap identified during the ACICF to ACG migration**, and to ensure this is addressed through the appropriate chain of command.

During the migration, **approximately 22 VMs were not transitioned to the ACG environment** due to unresolved technical dependencies (reported concerns around SQL Server access, data retrieval from the ACICF environment, and required port configurations). At this time, the **exact blockers remain unclear**.

The key risk I want to highlight is that **these VMs currently do not have the SCCM agent installed** and are therefore **not managed by any of our standard endpoint or configuration management tools**. As a result:

* These systems **do not receive patches, updates, or application deployments automatically**
* Any application installs or changes have been performed **manually**
* **Vulnerability remediation requires manual login**, which is also reflected in an associated **Problem Record** and involves the **EDM Vulnerability Remediation team**

Joe is aware of this situation, and at this stage, I believe **executive sponsorship and prioritization** is required to move this forward. I respectfully request that **Jeff Kolenda’s support** be leveraged to drive resolution and ensure these VMs are migrated and brought under standard management controls.

From a risk perspective, **any vulnerability exploitation or security incident on these unmanaged systems would directly impact ACG**. Given that **TCS is now the MSP**, I strongly recommend this item be treated with **utmost priority** and driven to closure at the earliest.

Additionally, as we plan the upcoming **migration from VMware Workspot to Citrix**, I would like to request that **these VMs be formally included within the migration scope**, so this gap is not carried forward.

For context:

* **Owner:** Marica
* **Support:** Dan has been kind enough to assist whenever requested
* **Related:** Existing Problem Record for vulnerability remediation

Please let me know the best next steps or if a focused discussion is required to align all stakeholders and unblock this effort.

Thank you for your time and support.

Regards,
Ari K
Tower Lead – EUC / Endpoint Management

If you want, I can:

* Make this **more assertive** (stronger risk language)
* Make it **shorter for exec audience**
* Add **explicit asks / action items**
* Rephrase for **client-facing leadership**

Just tell me the audience and tone.

Just tell me the tone you want.
