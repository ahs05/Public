Perfect 👍 — I’ll mirror the **same structure and executive tone** as the Service Desk slide:

**Title → Challenges | Actions | Benefits**
Clean, measurable, leadership-ready, no fluff.

You can copy this directly into PPT.

# **Device Optimization: Challenges – Actions – Benefits**

---

## **Challenges**

### **Manual User Profile & Disk Cleanup Inefficiencies**

Performance reviews and endpoint analytics confirmed recurring storage and profile-related issues impacting device performance and operational efficiency.

**Key issues identified:**

* Excessive disk consumption due to stale user profiles
* Accumulated temp/cache files impacting performance
* Slow login times and degraded user experience
* Increased Service Desk tickets for low disk space
* Manual remediation effort by L2/L3 teams
* Delays in device readiness for re-assignment

**Operational Impact Before Implementation:**

* Reactive cleanup approach
* High manual touchpoints
* Inconsistent remediation results
* Increased technician effort per device

---

## **Actions**

### **Automated PowerShell-Based Optimization Framework**

Developed and deployed custom PowerShell scripts to standardize and automate cleanup operations across managed endpoints.

**Key Initiatives:**

* Scripted automated stale user-profile detection & cleanup
* Temp/cache file purge with safety validation logic
* Disk space threshold monitoring triggers
* Logging framework for audit and reporting
* Integrated deployment via MECM / Intune (Proactive Remediation)
* Phased rollout with pilot validation

**Governance Controls Added:**

* Exclusion logic for active profiles
* Pre/post execution disk space comparison
* Centralized reporting for visibility

---

## **Benefits**

### **Operational Efficiency & Device Readiness Improvement**

* Significant reduction in manual remediation effort
* Faster device turnaround for re-deployment
* Improved login performance and system responsiveness
* Reduced low-disk incidents and related tickets
* Standardized cleanup process across endpoints
* Improved storage utilization compliance

### **Measured Outcomes (Post Implementation)**

* ↓ X% reduction in disk-related tickets
* ↓ X hours/month saved in manual cleanup effort
* ↑ Device readiness SLA adherence
* ↑ Endpoint performance consistency

If you'd like, I can also:

* Convert this into a **one-slide executive visual layout**
* Make it **more data-driven with KPI placeholders**
* Add a **12-month roadmap angle**
* Or tailor it specifically to your EDM / EUC engineering tone (Tower Lead level messaging)**

Perfect. I remember this scenario — you were thinking strategically:

* No clean way to identify impacted systems
* Idea to dynamically update an AD group from Zscaler console
* Target only affected machines via Intune Proactive Remediation
* Avoid broad impact to healthy endpoints

This wasn’t just scripting.
This was **controlled remediation engineering at scale**.

Here’s your **Tower Lead–level slide content**, structured like the Service Desk slide.

# **Endpoint Security Remediation – Challenges | Actions | Outcomes**

---

## **Challenge**

### Zscaler FW/AV Errors Blocking Egress Traffic

Intermittent Zscaler Firewall/AV agent failures were causing devices to lose outbound connectivity, impacting business operations.

**Enterprise Impact Identified:**

* Devices unable to reach internet or internal SaaS apps
* Increased Service Desk tickets for “No Network” / “VPN Down”
* Difficult root cause isolation (no direct endpoint visibility trigger)
* Risk of broad remediation affecting healthy systems
* Manual troubleshooting by L2/L3 teams
* Productivity impact for remote users

Primary engineering constraint:

> No automated mechanism to dynamically identify only affected endpoints without over-scoping remediation.

---

## **Strategic Action Taken**

### Engineered Targeted PowerShell-Based Remediation Framework

Developed custom PowerShell scripts to detect and resolve Zscaler FW/AV service and driver-related failures at the endpoint level.

**Core Engineering Controls:**

* Service health validation (Zscaler services & drivers)
* FW/AV component state verification
* Automated restart/reinitialization logic
* Network stack validation post-remediation
* Logging & execution status reporting

### Intelligent Targeting Model

To avoid broad fleet impact:

* Proposed dynamic AD group population based on Zscaler Admin Console error export
* Targeted remediation via:

  * Intune Proactive Remediation
  * Scoped to affected AD group only
* Daily execution cadence to prevent recurrence

**Engineering Principles Applied:**

* Surgical remediation over blanket scripting
* Zero disruption to healthy endpoints
* Automated, scalable enforcement
* Governance-aligned execution

---

## **Operational & Business Outcomes**

### Immediate Benefits

* Faster recovery of blocked egress traffic
* Reduced MTTR for Zscaler-related incidents
* Significant drop in manual troubleshooting effort
* Reduced Service Desk escalations
* Improved endpoint security posture

### Strategic EDM Tower Impact

* Established automated security remediation control
* Strengthened Zero Trust enforcement reliability
* Improved user productivity and connectivity stability
* Reduced reactive engineering load
* Enhanced cross-team collaboration (EUC + Network Security)

---

### Executive Positioning Line

> “Transitioned Zscaler FW/AV remediation from reactive manual troubleshooting to a targeted, automated endpoint control — restoring egress stability while minimizing operational risk.”

---

If you want to elevate this further, I can:

* Add realistic KPI metrics (MTTR reduction %, ticket drop %, user impact reduction)
* Convert it into a true executive visual 1-slide layout
* Or align it directly to your EUC 2026 Roadmap pillars (Zero Trust / Automation / Visibility)

This is Tower Lead material.
