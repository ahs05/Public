**Subject:** Windows Defender Firewall Service Issue – Investigation and Next Steps

Hello \[Recipient],

We are encountering an issue where, on a subset of Windows 10 and Windows 11 systems, the **Windows Defender Firewall service** remains stuck in either a *Starting* or *Stopping* state. This in turn causes the **Zscaler Agent** to report a FW/AV error, resulting in devices being blocked from initiating outbound traffic.

Our **current workaround** involves granting the System Account sufficient permissions to delete the `DebuggedLoopBackApps` registry key under:

```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\mpssvc\Parameters\AppCs
```

However, this process must be done manually. Because the `AppCs` registry keys are deeply protected by the OS, automation attempts have not been successful. This creates a resource burden for Level 1 and Level 2 technicians, who must remotely guide users through the manual steps just to restore connectivity. We already have \~30 affected devices, and we are concerned the issue may grow if left unaddressed.

We are working to understand the root cause and exploring sustainable, automated remediation options.

---

### Responses to Diagnostic Questions

* **Windows version/build**: Affects both Windows 10 (latest builds) and Windows 11.
* **Scope**: Issue observed across multiple systems (\~30 so far), not isolated to a single device.
* **Onset**: Issue began recently; no confirmed link yet to a specific patch, update, or configuration change.
* **Event Viewer logs**: Firewall service shows errors when attempting to start/stop, but no clear root cause identified.
* **Starting the service manually**: Attempts via *Services.msc* or PowerShell fail, as the service stays in *Starting* or *Stopping*.
* **Dependent services**: No dependent services appear stuck, only `mpssvc`.
* **Third-party antivirus/firewall**: None installed beyond built-in Defender. Zscaler is the only third-party security agent in use.
* **Recent GPO or registry changes**: No recent intentional changes pushed. Still under review if a group policy or Intune baseline may be influencing.
* **Domain/MDM**: All systems are domain-joined and managed through Intune.
* **Restart/Clean boot**: Restarting does not resolve the issue; registry intervention is required.
* **System file integrity checks**: SFC/DISM checks have been run on a few systems, no major corruption found.
* **Pending updates**: Affected systems were generally up-to-date with Windows Updates.

---

### Identified Resolution Path So Far

1. **Registry Permissions:**

   * Missing or restricted permissions at `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SharedAccess\Epoch` and under `AppCs`.
   * Providing System Account the necessary rights allows manual deletion of problematic subkeys.

2. **Duplicate SID Cleanup:**

   * In cases where `DebuggedLoopBackApps` contains duplicate SIDs, renaming or removing them restores firewall functionality.

3. **Manual Fix:**

   * Taking ownership of the `AppCs` key, granting permissions, and deleting the `DebuggedLoopBackApps` entry allows the Firewall service to start.
   * Machine restart is required to fully restore functionality.

---

### Key Challenges

* Current fixes require **manual registry edits**, which are not scalable.
* Attempts to script the solution (taking ownership, applying ACLs, deleting the keys) fail due to the high level of OS protection around `AppCs`.
* Impact is growing (30 devices affected) and remediation is resource-intensive, causing user downtime.

---

### Next Steps / Ask

* We are investigating **why Defender Firewall enters this state** (possible registry corruption or duplicate entries).
* We are seeking **guidance or tooling** to allow this remediation to be automated safely at scale (PowerShell, Intune remediation script, or other supported methods).
* Input is appreciated on whether this is a **known Windows issue** (potentially patch-related) or if a hotfix/workaround exists.

Would you like me to also draft a **shorter executive summary** version of this email (focused only on impact, current workaround, and request for escalation) that you could send to management, while keeping this detailed version for engineering/support escalation?
