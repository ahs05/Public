The long term solution for that is where this is where Personas is going to come into. Because once we truly identify the Personas and the groups, we can start getting creative even from a build process. Because one day saying all our task sequences and stuff are going to go away. Right when we go to Entra only, which is the direction we want to go. We want to get into the cloud Okay. What we're doing today is predicated on a solution that was for an on-premise workforce. All this active directory, even SCCM. it's old, it's old school, it works. But our work environment has changed, the world has changed and the work environment we have now is probably 50, or 60, 40, maybe even more remote. And we need a solution that can get us to a remote work to better serve a remote workforce. And that would be obviously Entra Only in the cloud it flattens out. You don't need the naming convention issue we have today. We flatten everything out and we start. Now is the time to start building the Personas. This is where it becomes important so that I go to autopilot. I'm not going to have the luxury of just, you know, having predefined images. You're going to have devices that come down based on whatever tag, whatever the device is tagged at or if the user is tagged at. Those apps will follow the user or follow whatever group tag that that device is a part of. So everything just kind of comes down naturally. That's kind of where we want to go. That's the direction and Personas will be. Applications will be delivered ideally through. Ideally we either get rid of the applications like a lot of these frontline applications and some will be browser base that will lighten the footprint on a device. so that gives you an idea. We need to identify Personas and it's going to be a Lot like it's not, you're not going to shrink the Personas necessarily. You may have like contact center, but it branches out to, you know, insurance, claims, membership, travel, and the same with back office is going to even get bigger. You're going to have a lot of persons, that’s okey as long as you identify them and identify the need.
And then once we've done that, we will have to start looking at things like how we automate getting to onboard and off boarding. Like this is a longer view, right. I would start leaning more on the Intune area. You're always going to fine tune SCCM, but the direction is Intune. Intune is where we're going. Okay, how do we get, how do we get these Personas built up in Intune and things delivered that way?
That's the future state because this is coming out of the gate. Start defining Personas and start building them up in Intune and be able to leverage, leverage the apps that way. Think about this. I'm going to put something into maybe Workday. I think Everything starts in HR and Workday that should have an API called into ServiceNow. ServiceNow can then start putting all the provisioning of the device, the groups and all that and that should feed into Intune. Orchestrator should then feed that into Intune and all the groups, and this is 10,000ft. | don't have that in tandem. Let's start doing an entra only build. And I, I had limited resources.

-------------
During our meeting yesterday morning, I asked that you work closely with the ACG team (Joe, Mike, and Dave) regarding personas and drive/lead working sessions with them to understand their perspective and leverage their knowledge about the business and IT specifics.
 
As I mentioned, please note that this coming Monday you will be presenting TCS’ approach to defining and leading change around personas.  I asked that you conduct working sessions this week the team and by Friday we have a meeting to review that slide deck that demonstrates the approach for personas.  Have you scheduled that Friday meeting?  Have you started meeting with the team as a group to gather insight and perspective needed?
 
That Monday meeting is critical to ensure we are defining and paving the way for personas at ACG.
