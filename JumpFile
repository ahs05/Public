For any system that reported any problem, the DSS team was given that information to initiate a replacement of the devices after the EDM initial troubleshooting process was conducted.

What I can recall for every 200 systems, 2 or 3 had issues, most of them due to the large number of users that signed into the device or not compatible software

Process that I follow to try to clear the issues

-	Remote and log using local Admin Account
-	Clear Temp folders 7 Recycle Bin & Old User profiles based on usage history (SCCM)
-	Remove manually any no compatible software
-	Run the IPU process using the Setup.exe file
-	If the IPU process failed at this time, then the DSS group got notified.

Thanks Winston this is very useful. One more question, so do you remember how many of the deployments were failing and how many tech we involved in troubleshooting and sending out new equipment for the one which run into issues?

I can only tell you what I did when I got involved with the Windows 7 to Windows 10 upgrade process experience and we can use that information for the Windows 11 IPU process.

Note: At that time ACG was not using the Microsoft Autopatch services and we only had remote users in Laptops, most of the other remote user were using Citrix VDI with Wyse terminal services.

The EDM team which had 7 support techs and 1 manager at that time

*.- Test all the Windows 10 Task Sequences Images on new builds with the Application owners (Joe Z., David G., Jim G., Dan T.)
*.- Test the in-place upgrade (IPU),  (David G. & Jim G.)
*.- Windows 10 Domain Group Policies (Jeff K., Shaun K.)

After David G. & Jim G. could not find a solution, I got involve working on the IPU process.

*.- I created a Task Sequence that will run the IPU process on all the workstations.
*.- Desktop Support team started to use the Widdows 10 TS on any replacement or new device once we started to push the W10 IPU on the PROD systems
*.- The deployment of this IPU process was done based on the device type like the Persistent Citrix VDI (IT Users, Developers Users), Desktop (IT Users, Back Office AOB Users & Branch Users) and Laptops groups. 
*.- Initial deployment IPU started with 20 systems on the weekend as a test and then we increased the number to 200 per weekend, we completed the upgrade for each device group before we moved to the next group.
*.- All the Executives devices upgrade were handle by the support team assigned to them


Note: As of today, we have 11229 Configuration Manager Workstations clients and only 8670+ physical devices are Windows 11 compatible, we do not have the Persistent VDI that were use to run most of the test of the applications.


 


Based on the above information and what I can suggest for this Windows 11 upgrade, these are the steps that need to be done:

*.- Confirm that the Windows 11 Domain Group Policy is ready.
*.- Persistent VDI (Citrix & Workspot) need to be Windows 11 ready.
*.- Create & Test all Windows 11 Task sequence on new devices with the application owners (Most critical apps for regular users & developers).
*.- Test the IPU Task Sequence deployment Process on PROD Windows 10 systems, using the current Windows 10 TS PROD
*.- All support team needs to be educated in how to troubleshoot a failed upgrade. Follow Microsoft tech solutions

*.- Decided the groups that will be target, for the initial test and PROD
*.- Create Collection and submit the CHG for each deployment.
