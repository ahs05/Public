**Subject:** Request for Volunteers to Support Windows 11 App Testing – ImageRight Issue Tracking

Hi Michael,

We were informed that our Hypercare and EDM team members have successfully resolved the issue mentioned below. Please let us know if you’re still experiencing any challenges on your end.

To ensure your team is fully prepared for a successful transition to Windows 11, we’d like to confirm that all your critical departmental apps are properly tested and vetted for compatibility. With that in mind, could you kindly provide 5–8 volunteers from your team to help us validate key applications in a Windows 11 environment? Our goal is to run through a few test scenarios and ensure that everything functions as expected before the production rollout.

As an example, ImageRight is one of the apps we’re tracking closely. While we were unable to reproduce the reported issue on our Surface device, it did occur for an ACICF user. We’d like to test with another ACICF user—preferably with your team’s involvement—to witness the app launch and behavior firsthand. We’re specifically trying to determine whether the problem stems from a missing .NET assembly, UAC restrictions, or something else.

Your support in identifying a few testers will help us build a well-rounded test set and ensure readiness.

Appreciate your help as always. Let me know if you have any questions or need more details.

Best regards,
\[Your Name]
\[Your Title / Team Name]
