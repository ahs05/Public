**Subject:** Update: Enhanced SQL Queries for Device Compatibility and Capacity Insights

Hi Team,

Just a quick note to let you know that I’ve enhanced the existing SQL queries used to identify Compatible and Non-Compatible Windows 11 devices. These improvements now include additional data points such as Hard Disk Capacity, Free Disk Space, and Total RAM Size. This should enable us to make more informed decisions where needed.

 – I understand you rely on SCCM DB queries for similar insights, so I wanted to make sure you’re aware of this update.

No action is required from anyone at this time.

Best regards,
\[Your Name]
