Hi Leadership Team,

I’m sharing a consolidated update on the **Dell Pro 14 imaging issues** that have been impacting device deployments for the past several months. This is a **recurring, unresolved issue** despite multiple engagements with Dell and internal troubleshooting efforts.
I wanted to provide a consolidated summary of the ongoing imaging issues observed with Dell Pro 14 laptops, which have been occurring consistently over the past ~3 months.
---

### **Executive Summary**

* Imaging failures on Dell Pro 14 laptops have been consistently observed since **late September 2025**.
* The issue manifests during **WinPE**, primarily as **network-related failures** that prevent task sequence execution.
* Multiple Dell-recommended BIOS and driver remediation attempts have **not resolved the issue**.
* Dell has **closed the original support case without resolution** and is requiring a **new ticket for further escalation**.

---

### **Timeline Highlights**

* **Sep 26, 2025** – Dell ProSupport case opened (Case #216380273) for imaging/network failures.
* **Sep–Oct 2025** – BIOS alignment and driver troubleshooting recommended by Dell; no confirmed fix.
* **Oct 25, 2025** – Dell closed the case despite the issue persisting.
* **Nov–Dec 2025** – Internal ACG, BIT, and Dell account teams re-engaged; no resolution identified.
* **Dec 23, 2025** – Additional Intel NIC driver tested per Dell recommendation; unsuccessful.
* **Jan 13, 2026** – Dell released updated PB14250 driver pack; remediation attempt failed.
* **Jan 26, 2026** – Dell confirmed no further support until a **new escalation ticket is opened**.

(Full detailed timeline attached.)

### **Current Impact**

* Imaging failures continue to delay device provisioning.
* Increased hands-on engineering time per device.
* Elevated operational risk as deployment volumes increase.
* Issue remains **unresolved and reproducible**.

---

### **Temporary Workaround**

* Imaging is successful **only when the laptop is connected via a docking station**.
* This workaround is **not scalable**, introduces dependency on additional hardware, and slows deployment throughput.

---

### **Current Status**

**Unresolved – Action Required**

---

### **Proposed Next Steps / Decision Needed**

1. Approval to open a **new Dell ProSupport escalation** with executive-level pressure.
2. Alignment on continuing use of the **dock-based workaround** as a temporary measure.
3. Approval to proceed with **boot image and driver strategy review** to reduce future vendor dependency.

Please let us know if you would like a brief walkthrough or deeper technical review of the findings.

Thanks,
