Here’s a **polished, professional email** based on your content, with clarity, leadership tone, and proper justification filled in:

Hello Team,

Attached is the **list of systems that require replacement at the earliest**.

Based on reports from **SCCM and Intune/Autopatch**, these systems have **not been receiving Windows monthly security patches for an extended period of time**. As a result, they are consistently failing patch compliance and are **negatively impacting our overall compliance metrics**.

Please note that the **EDM team has already completed due diligence** on these devices. This includes extensive troubleshooting of failed Windows Updates following **industry best practices**. Despite these efforts, the issues persist and are not recoverable through standard remediation.

While the list includes both **Windows 10 and Windows 11 devices**, we have collectively agreed to **prioritize the replacement of Windows 10 systems first** for the following reasons:

* These devices have been **in the replacement queue for an extended period**
* They **do not meet the minimum hardware requirements for Windows 11**
* Continued use poses an **ongoing compliance and security risk**

We would appreciate it if the replacement of these systems could be **completed at the earliest possible timeframe** to help restore patch compliance and reduce audit risk.

Please let us know if additional information or coordination is required from our side.

Thank you for your support and cooperation.

Best regards,
Ari K

If you want, I can also provide:

* a **short executive summary version** for leadership threads.
