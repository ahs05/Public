Hi team – just a quick heads-up:

As part of our W11 Prod schedule, we’ve decided to exclude devices with 8GB RAM or less from the upgrade deployment (Prod & Pilot). A comms draft is in progress to notify impacted users and guide them to submit a PC Accessory Request via ServiceNow for RAM upgrades.

Once the RAM is upgraded, those devices will be added back to the deployment list.

Shanthi is working on the draft and will loop you in soon for review/approval before we send it out.

Let me know if you have any questions!
