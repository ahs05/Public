Certainly! Here's the revised version with that included:

Team,
As discussed on yesterday’s call, Shathi has sent out the finalized comms to:
• BU/Department Leads – requesting volunteers to test out W11
• App Owners/SMEs/Power Users – also requesting volunteers to test W11

We’ve already started receiving some requests to have users and a few of their team members added to the volunteer list.

Just wanted to keep everyone in the loop.

Let me know if you want it even shorter or more informal.
