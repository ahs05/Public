Here’s a **more technical, AD-centric version** that clearly addresses **schema vs. extensionAttribute usage**, **delegation**, and **security considerations**, while maintaining a professional flow for AD Security admins:

Hello Team,

I am reaching out to request your support on an **Active Directory configuration change** required for an ongoing ACG initiative led by the TCS Transformation team.

**Requirement Overview:**
We need to leverage **five (5) user-level attributes in Active Directory** to store and manage **User Persona identifiers**. Our preference is to utilize existing **extensionAttribute fields** (e.g., extensionAttribute1–15) if available, rather than introducing new custom schema attributes, to minimize schema impact and risk.

If the existing extensionAttributes are already allocated or reserved, we are open to discussing:

* Creation of **new custom schema attributes**, or
* Alternative supported attributes that align with AD governance standards.

**Use Case / Background:**
The User Persona framework will drive **persona-based application deployment**, ensuring applications are dynamically installed based on the user’s assigned persona. These attributes will act as authoritative signals consumed by downstream systems (e.g., SCCM / Intune) for targeting and automation.

**Access & Delegation Model:**
We are requesting **delegated permissions** (not full administrative rights) to:

* **Write/modify only the specified attributes**
* **Scope access to user objects only**
* Ideally restrict delegation to a **dedicated AD security group or service account**, following least-privilege principles

We do **not** require permissions to create or modify schema objects directly, unless explicitly required by the agreed design.

**Governance & Process:**
If there is an **internal change process, schema review board, or security approval workflow** that needs to be followed for:

* Attribute usage confirmation,
* Schema extensions (if needed), or
* Delegation approval,

please let us know the required steps and documentation. We will align fully with AD governance standards.

**Next Steps:**
I will be scheduling a working session to:

* Confirm attribute strategy (extensionAttribute vs. custom schema)
* Review delegation and security boundaries
* Align on implementation timelines and ownership

Thank you in advance for your guidance and support.

Best regards,
Ari K

If you want, I can also:

* add **exact LDAP attribute names & example values**, or
* convert this into a **formal AD change request / CAB-ready version**.
