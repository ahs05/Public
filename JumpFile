**Subject:** Dell Pro 14 PB250 – PXE Imaging Findings and Recommended Path

Hi Kamal / Kenny,

Following the technical escalation with Dell (Casey Downing), we reviewed the ongoing PXE imaging challenges with the Dell Pro 14 PB250 platform.

**Key takeaways:**

* Dell confirmed our boot image drivers appear healthy; the issue is unlikely driver-related.
* Their assessment points toward a **Layer-2/network physical behavior** (packet loss or link negotiation sensitivity) rather than MECM or WinPE configuration.
* Importantly, the devices **image successfully and consistently when using the Dell docking station**, which Dell considers the supported and stable path.

Dell noted that traditional PXE is a legacy technology and newer hardware platforms are becoming increasingly sensitive to cabling quality, switch behavior, and physical link characteristics. They provided several network-level troubleshooting steps (port mirroring, short cable validation, PortFast testing, duplex experiments, etc.); however, they were clear that even with extensive tuning there is **no guaranteed outcome** for direct-NIC PXE reliability on these models.

**Operational clarification:**
A single docking station can be reused to image multiple Dell systems sequentially. There is **no requirement to dedicate one dock per device**, which helps minimize any additional hardware footprint at the imaging stations.

Given:

* The deterministic success via docking
* The manageable operational model using shared docks
* The potentially high cross-team engineering effort required
* The uncertain probability of full resolution

We recommend leadership alignment on whether to:

1. Continue deep network/root-cause investigation, **or**
2. Establish dock-based imaging as the standard for the Dell Pro 14 PB250 class.

From an engineering efficiency and risk standpoint, option (2) may provide the fastest path to operational stability, but we can proceed based on leadership direction.

Please advise how you would like us to proceed.

Thanks,
