You’re asking exactly the right questions — this is where many people get tripped up when moving from **Power BI Desktop → real enterprise sharing**.

Let me walk you through it cleanly for your situation.

---

# 🧭 Your Current State (based on what you said)

✅ Power BI Desktop installed
✅ Intune Data Warehouse OData working
✅ Sample report built
✅ Microsoft Fabric (Free) assigned

👉 **BUT:** Fabric Free ≠ full sharing rights

This is the key nuance.

---

# 🎯 Short Answer First

* ❌ Publishing for broad sharing is **NOT fully free**
* ✅ You can publish to *My Workspace* with free
* ❌ Team consumption usually requires **Power BI Pro or Premium capacity**
* ⚠️ Workspaces visibility depends on permissions
* ⚠️ Piggybacking on someone’s workspace requires them to grant access

Now let’s go step-by-step like an enterprise rollout.

---

# 🔄 Step 1 — How Publishing Actually Works

From Power BI Desktop:

**Home → Publish → choose workspace**

What happens next:

* Report uploads to Power BI Service (cloud)
* Dataset is created
* Report becomes web-accessible
* Then permissions/sharing control access

So yes — publishing happens via the Service.

---

# 💰 Is Publishing Free?

## 🟢 With Fabric Free license

You can:

* Publish to **My Workspace**
* View your own reports
* Experiment and learn

You cannot reliably:

* Share with others in most org setups
* Publish to shared workspaces (usually blocked)
* Allow others to view (they’ll get license error)

---

## 🔵 For Team/Leadership Sharing (REAL world)

You typically need **one of these**:

### Option A — Power BI Pro (most common)

Everyone needs Pro:

* Author → Pro
* Viewers → Pro

💲 Roughly $10/user/month

---

### Option B — Premium Capacity (enterprise)

If workspace is in Premium:

* Author → Pro
* Viewers → **Free allowed**

But only if your org owns Premium/Fabric capacity.

---

## 🚨 IMPORTANT FOR YOU

**Fabric Free license alone is usually NOT enough for org-wide sharing.**

You need to verify:

👉 Do we have Power BI Pro?
👉 Do we have Premium capacity?

---

# 🔍 Step 2 — How to See Workspaces in Your Org

Go to:

👉 [https://app.powerbi.com](https://app.powerbi.com)
👉 Left pane → **Workspaces**

You will only see:

* Workspaces you created
* Workspaces you were granted access to

❗ You cannot see all org workspaces by default.

---

## 🧠 Enterprise Reality

In ACG/TCS-type environments:

* Workspaces are tightly controlled
* Usually owned by BI/Data teams
* Not auto-visible to everyone
* Often tied to governance model

---

# 🤝 Step 3 — Can You Piggyback Someone Else’s Workspace?

## ✅ YES — if they grant you access

They must add you as:

* Member
* Contributor
* Admin

Then you can publish there.

---

## 🚫 You CANNOT:

* Automatically use others’ workspace
* See them without permission
* Publish into them without role assignment

---

## 🏢 Best Practice (enterprise)

For your EUC/Intune reporting scenario, typically:

* Dedicated workspace per domain/team
* Not random piggybacking
* Governed access

---

# 🆓 Step 4 — Creating Your Own Workspace

## Is creating workspace free?

👉 Creating workspace = **Free**

BUT…

👉 **Sharing from it = license dependent**

This is the trap many miss.

---

## What happens with Fabric Free:

You can:

* Create workspace (sometimes allowed by tenant)
* Publish report
* See it yourself

But viewers may get:

❌ “This content requires Power BI Pro”

---

# 🔍 Step 5 — What You Should Do Next (Practical Path)

Since you're in enterprise environment, do this:

### ✅ Check your license precisely

Go to:

👉 M365 Admin Center → Users → Your account
Look for:

* Power BI Pro
* Power BI Premium Per User
* Fabric Free (you already saw)

---

### ✅ Ask internally (very important)

Ask your BI/Data team or admin:

* Do we have Power BI Premium capacity?
* Is there an existing workspace for Endpoint/Intune reporting?
* Can I get Pro license?

---

### ✅ For learning right now

You can safely:

* Publish to My Workspace
* Build dashboards
* Test refresh

---

# 🔥 My Honest Recommendation (based on your role)

Given you're doing **Intune/EUC analytics**, best enterprise path is:

👉 Get **Power BI Pro license**
👉 Request or create **EUC/Endpoint workspace**
👉 Avoid random piggybacking
👉 Align with BI governance early

This will save you headaches later.

# 🚀 If You Want Next-Level Guidance

Say:

**“Help me design an Intune Power BI workspace architecture for enterprise”**

I can give you a production-ready model that will impress Kamal/Kenny level leadership.
