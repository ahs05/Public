**Subject:** Request for UAT Testing on Windows 11 for Installed Application

Greetings for the day!

As part of our upcoming IT initiative, we are preparing to roll out the Windows 11 operating system across all Windows 10 devices within our organization. This rollout is scheduled for completion by the end of October 2025.

According to our records, the following application is currently installed on your device:

▶️ **[App Name Here]**

At this time, we do not have an assigned Application Owner, Subject Matter Expert (SME), or Power User for this application in our IT database.

To support this initiative, we are reaching out to check if you would be able to assist by performing UAT (User Acceptance Testing) on a Temporary Windows 11 VDI Device. If you are available to help, please let us know and we will coordinate with the VDI team to provision access for you.

Post your confirmation, we will assign you the temporary VDI device and provide all the necessary instructions/next steps for completing the testing.

If you are not the right person to perform this testing but know someone who might be, we would greatly appreciate it if you could share their contact information so we can update our records accordingly.

Thank you for your support!
