**Meeting Notes: Discussion with Azul Engineering - CACerts Loading Issue**

**Date:** [Insert Date]

**Attendees:** [Insert Attendees]

**Subject:** ECM Web App - Java CACerts Loading Discrepancy

**Summary:**
This morning, I met with the engineering team at Azul to discuss the identified issue where the ECM web application is being launched using the installed Azul JRE, but the CACerts are being loaded from the Oracle Java 8u202 installation directory.

**Key Points Discussed:**

1. **Licensing Implications:**
   - **Azul Confirmation:** Copying the CACerts to the Oracle Java 8u202 installation directory does not violate any licensing terms.
   - **Security Consideration:** Since we are actively maintaining security by locking down the Java 8u202 installation directory, copying the CACerts should not pose any risks. Oracle will not have grounds for a licensing violation as the files in the `lib\security` directory are allowed to be modified, though not deleted.

2. **Technical Behavior:**
   - **Issue Root Cause:** The ECM web app’s behavior stems from `jp2launcher.exe`, which requests the JVM on the machine to provide a CACert. The JVM then supplies the CACert from its home directory (which is set to the Oracle Java 8u202 installation on certain machines), leading to a DeploymentRuleSet.jar file violation.
   - **Azul’s Limitation:** The Azul JRE does not have the capability to alter this behavior, meaning the issue arises due to environmental factors on the affected machines.

3. **Potential Causes Identified:**
   - **Environment Variables:** The behavior might be caused by user environment variables or modifications done to the system by the user.
   - **System Configuration:** The Azul support team suspects this discrepancy is due to differences in system configurations across the machines where the issue is observed.

4. **Next Steps:**
   - **Escalation:** The Azul support team will escalate the issue to their engineers for further investigation and assistance.
   - **Internal Review:** We need to review the system configurations and environment variables on the affected machines to identify any inconsistencies that might contribute to this issue.

**Action Items:**
- [Your Name]: Review the environment variables and system configurations of the affected machines.
- [Azul Support Team]: Await further insights from the Azul escalation engineers and coordinate with them for a potential resolution.

**Conclusion:**
This meeting clarified that while the copying of CACerts to the Oracle directory is permissible, the root cause of the issue lies in the interaction between system configurations and JVM behavior. Further technical analysis will be required to fully resolve the issue.

Import CIS Benchmark Baselines to Intune: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUYQ7gWFWDc

The way I do this:
1. Login to CIS Workbench and download CIS Build Pack for given benchmark eg Windows 11... (https://workbench.cisecurity.org/)
2. Unzip the build pack 
3. Import whatever you need to Intune GPO Analyser
4. You can even merge GPOs in Intune eg  Comp L1 and Comp L2
5. Review and select policies
6. Export as Intune configuration profile
Done
This way you have original stuff from CIS. You can edit this - add, remove etc.

 TO do this we will first need to know the commands we need to run

#Find the permission available
Find-mggraphcommand -command Get-mggroup | Select -first 1 -expandproperty Permissions

 # For Expample we wnat to create and update a group so the best match is Group.readWrite.All

Find-mggraphcommand -command Get-mguser | Select -first 1 -expandproperty Permissions

# For Expample we wnat to create and update a group so the best match is User.read.All

# Now that we know the permisions needed. (THeriry of least permissions) 
So we are granting the rights we need - AKA passing in the permissions we need. 

COnnect-mggraph -scope "Group.readWrite.All", "User.read.All"
